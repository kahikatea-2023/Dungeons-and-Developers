A group project with the goal of rolling some dice and getting some funny outcomes relevant to the developer experience. We used ChatGPT to write our hilarious outcomes. Add your players and take turns rolling to see who's the best dev in the dungeon!

We had loads of fun making this with a stressful end of day git merge fest. We had so many wishes for this and requests to add some of our stretch goals (detailed below). 

### How to Play

Click the CLICK ME!!! then click the corresponding tile to see your outcome

## Stretch Goals

- Turn it into a board game
- Adding a 3D dice! We almost had this implemented but had issues due to deprecated dependant packages.
- Turn tracker
- Users can add custom challenges

## Tech

- React
- Tanstack (react-query)
- SQLite3
- TypeScript

## Installation

```
git clone 
cd [your-project-name]
npm install # to install dependencies
npm run knex migrate:latest to make tables
npm run knex seed:run to seed tables
npm run dev # to start the dev server
```

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
